  <h2>From Intelligence Analyst to Developer</h2>
  <p>
    After several years as an intelligence analyst, and feeling a bit like my
    career trajectory was not aligned with my interests and goals, I decided to
    start building a new set of skills to make a change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unsure where to start, I tried everything I was interested in. I studied
    computer networking, restored old furniture, built a quadcopter (only
    started one electrical fire!), took a couple Udemy courses to build games in
    C# and C++, developed a passion for astrophotography, and joined the ranks
    of thousands of Coursera dropouts. Through this process I learned I wanted
    to land in a field where I could be creative, where I could build things,
    and where I could do something technical. I didn't want to incur the
    financial and time-consuming debt of going back to university.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a few free HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses I enrolled in Thinkful's
    full-stack development program to build some foundational knowledge. For me,
    web development became an engaging cycle of designing, learning,
    programming, and creative problem-solving. I was hooked.
  </p>
  <p>
    In early 2019, I said farewell to my career as an intel analyst. I helped
    build and maintain enterprise-scale Angular and React applications with Booz
    Allen Hamilton and Secureworks, working with and learning from some amazing
    people (and grew an obsession with composing RxJS streams).
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, when I'm not trying to make my daughters laugh (toddlers are the
    best audience), I'm looking for new things to learn and build. For examples
    of my development work and photography, check out my <a href="/projects"

    and
